## Rationale

`updates` and `updated-by` apply only to EIPs in `active` status as updates to EIPs in `final` status are already handled by EIP headers `superseded-by` and `replaces`.

The syntax should align with previous EIP header syntax, as this EIP is not updating syntax, simply adding header options.

## Backwards Compatibility

These EIP headers are optional and do not introduce compatibility issues.


## Implementation

An implementation is adding a header option.
